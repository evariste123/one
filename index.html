                    Any reference to "Hour of AI" should be used in <br>
                     a fashion that doesn't suggest that it's your own brand name, <br>
                      but rather referencing the Hour of AI as a grassroots movement. <br>

Good example: "Participate in the Hour of AI at YOUR-COMPANY.com." <br>

Bad example: "Try Hour of AI by YOUR-COMPANY." <br>

Include language on your page (or in the footer), including links to the  <br>
CSEdWeek and HourofAI.org websites, that says the following: "The EB website <br>
 is a global initiative by Computer Science Education Week [csedweek.org] and the EB website  <br>
  to introduce millions of students to artificial intelligence." No use of "Hour of AI" in app names. <br>
